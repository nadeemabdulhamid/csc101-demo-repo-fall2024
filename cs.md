# CSC 101 - About Computer Science


## Why study computer science?

- I took two computer science classes in my jurnior year of high school. These two classes tought me how to program HTML, CSS, and Python. I found that the process of programming different applications and websites gave me a satisfaction that I had never felt before.




## What skills/tools/attitudes/knowledge/competencies will help you succeed in computer science?

- I pick up skills faster than most. For instance, it only took me two weeks to learn how to play the tenor saxophone for marching band.






## How will you get there?

- I already code in my off time. I'll make it.
